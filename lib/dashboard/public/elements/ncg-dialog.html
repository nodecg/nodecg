<!--
You may notice some oddness with this element. Namely that the `.buttons` div appears before the
`paper-dialog-scrollable` element in `dashboard.jade`, but in the below `<style>` tag I've forced
`.buttons` to have an `order` of `3`, making it appear after `paper-dialog-scrollable`.

This was done to fix a bizarre issue wherein any nodes placed after the `paper-dialog-scrollable`
were not appearing in the DOM. I do not know how or why this was happening, so this flexbox hack
is the only thing I could come up with. Let us never speak of this again.
