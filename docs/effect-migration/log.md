# Effect-TS Migration Log

This log documents our journey migrating NodeCG to Effect-TS. Each entry captures decisions, challenges, and learnings from migrating specific subsystems.

## How to Use This Log

When working on a migration:

1. Create a new entry with the date and subsystem name
2. Document key decisions as you make them
3. Record problems and solutions when they arise
4. Update the status as work progresses
5. Add lessons learned when completing the migration
